#### PONG!

Hi. This game is structured as follows:

## Tutorial Section

Instructions will be presented by a modal.

## Banner

- Start Button
- Title
- Score

## Board

- Paddle
- Ballâ€¨

When Start Button is clicked the Ball will start moving towards left/right, it will bounce off the border of the **Board**. The user will then try to move the paddle to avoid the ball hitting the left side of the screen
